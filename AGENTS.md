# PERSPECTA Standing Agent Instructions

## PRISM tracing (do not remove)

This project sends traces to PRISM. Env vars: `PRISMTRACE_API_KEY`,
`PRISMTRACE_PROJECT_ID`, `PRISMTRACE_HOST`.

Tracing is currently wired at: lib/prism-tracer.ts, app/api/analyze/route.ts, .env, .env.local, .env.example

**Standing rule.** Whenever you add or change an agent, chain, graph, tool,
retriever, or any entry point that calls a model, wire it to PRISM before you
finish. Unwired code is invisible in the dashboard. If you are unsure whether
something is covered, assume it is not and wire it.
